 Improved Recommendation Algorithm for NCF Models
 ===
 The paper introduces Neural Collaborative Filtering with Multiple Attention Heads (NCF-MAH), an innovative recommendation algorithm designed to improve the accuracy and personalization of recommendations. This model enhances traditional methods by utilizing a negative sample set and matrix decomposition to transform user and item IDs into low-dimensional embedding vectors. It then applies a multi-head attention mechanism to these embeddings, converting them into query, key, and value vectors to compute attention scores and weighted sums. The final step involves integrating the outputs from the multi-head attention mechanism with those from a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict scores. Experimental results demonstrate that NCF-MAH outperforms baseline models on the MOOC platform and other datasets, showing improvements of 13% and 9.8% in hit rate (HR) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) at top-10, and 15.7% and 12.8% at top-20
